# Food Delivery React App
## Description
Welcome to Quartet-S delivery app. This is a simple app that enables users to browse through the menu, 
add food items to their cart and place an order. The admin has the ability to manage the menu by
adding, uodating or deleting food items

## Setup

After unbundling the project:

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port `8001`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `8000`.

Make sure to open
[http://localhost:8001/transactions](http://localhost:8001/transactions) in the
browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

The app uses [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) for styling. If you see any
unfamiliar classNames on some components, don't sweat! That's coming from
Semantic UI and you shouldn't need to touch it.
